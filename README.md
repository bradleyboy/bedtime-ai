# Tonight's Bedtime Story: An experiment with the OpenAI API

This repo hosts the code that runs [bedtime-ai.nokk.io](https://bedtime-ai.nokk.io). It uses the OpenAI API to generate unique bedtime stories from a prompt, including a cover image for the story and an audio reading for playback in a browser.

The app is built on [Nokkio](https://www.nokk.io/), a fully managed React framework.
